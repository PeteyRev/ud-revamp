                                <p>On this page, you will find more information about your order shipping and fulfillment process.
                                    You will also find our returns policy for UPLIFT products, and other brands we offer.</p>
                                <p>Most orders go into production as soon as the order is placed. Please call us immediately
                                    if you would like to make changes to your order. We will make every effort to make the
                                    changes before the order ships, but order changes will reset the lead time on the order
                                    as the process for your order will restart. If changes need to be made after an order
                                    is shipped, there will be additional shipping costs involved.</p>

                                <p>Every UPLIFT Desk ships for free to commercial and residential locations in the United States
                                    (lower 48). Please allow additional processing and shipping time for any holidays. Most
                                    desks 72" wide or less will ship ground. If your desktop is wider than 72" or made of
                                    solid wood, the desk will ship via freight truck. Standard free freight shipping includes
                                    loading dock or curbside service; you will be in charge of bringing the individually
                                    boxed items inside. Upgraded delivery options are also available, as described below.
                                    Once you place your order, we'll contact you to make sure we arrange the most appropriate
                                    free shipping method based on your needs, if required.</p>

                                <p>Some items are eligible for faster shipping speeds. Please note that this will not affect
                                    your order's processing time, only the amount of time the order spends in transit. To
                                    see the latest estimate of when your order will ship, consult your shopping cart.</p>

                                <p>If you are shipping to Alaska or Hawaii we can still ship to your residence or commercial
                                    location. Shipping will be calculated at checkout, and we will contact you after you
                                    place your order with shipping information and costs for orders that cannot be calculated
                                    online. A less expensive option is to purchase a <a href="http://www.upliftdesk.com/adjustable-height-frames/">frame only</a>,
                                    which ships from our warehouse the same or next day, and use a top that you buy locally.</p>
                                <h3>International Shipping</h3>
                                <p>UPLIFT Desk offers international shipping of nearly all products to Canada. We also offer
                                    international shipping to countries other than Canada if ordering over $2,000 of UPLIFT
                                    Desk products. APOs outside of Canada fall under this international shipping policy.
                                    Desktops are not shipped outside the United States or Canada, so if you want a full sit-stand
                                    desk, we suggest that you buy <a href="http://www.upliftdesk.com/adjustable-height-frames/">UPLIFT base frames only</a>                                    (over $2,000 worth) and source your desktops locally. For international orders, we may
                                    require a wire transfer for payment at our discretion, and taxes and brokerage fees will
                                    apply.</p>
                                <p>International shipping rates are determined on a case-by-case basis, with the exception of
                                    Canada <a href="#canadaship">(see below)</a>. You may call us at <a href="tel:512-614-3152">512-614-3152</a>                                    or <a href="tel:800-349-3839">800-349-3839</a> to get a shipping quote and place your
                                    order. If you prefer to order online, we will contact you with shipping information and
                                    costs after the order is placed.</p>
                                <p>Alternatively, we can always ship for free to your freight forwarder in the United States.
                                    If you have additional questions about freight forwarding or international shipping please

                                    <li><strong>Shipping to Canada</strong> - Desks shipped to Canada will either ship via freight
                                        for a flat rate of $249 or with FedEx Ground to Canada with rates based on items
                                        ordered. Shipping cost estimates are not always accurate, and a member of our team
                                        will reach out to confirm your order. Large, multiple desk orders may ship freight.
                                        Accessories and frames without tops can be ordered directly through the website as
                                        well. To save on shipping costs on your desk, frame, or accessory order, you may
                                        want to use a border mail service like <a href="https://www.kinek.com/" target="_blank">Kinek</a>,
                                        which reduces shipping and brokerage fees. That way you can take advantage of free
                                        shipping to the lower 48 United States. Shipping to Canada may be available with
                                        extra fees, depending on the shipping method chosen. FedEx Ground to Canada must
                                        pay for taxes and brokerage fees, while FedEx International Economy and International
                                        Priority must pay for only the taxes. Duties and taxes are assessed by the Canadian
                                        government and may vary by province and locality. In most cases, we do not collect
                                        and/or pre-pay duties, goods and services tax or other taxes or fees.</li>

                                <p>We think you&rsquo;ll love your new UPLIFT desk but sometimes it just doesn&rsquo;t work
                                    out. If you decide to send your desk back, you can do so with no restocking fees on single
                                    UPLIFT desks with standard GREENGUARD-certified laminate, Eco and Eco Curve, 1&rdquo;
                                    thick bamboo, or reclaimed wood desktops, and single UPLIFT frame-only orders. You will
                                    just have to let us know that you are planning to return the item within 30 days of receiving
                                    your desk and we will issue a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number. Unfortunately,
                                    solid wood tops and custom laminates are made to order and therefore not returnable.
                                    However, you may return the frame only if you would like. If you are in the market for
                                    multiple desks, please order one desk first to test out our product. Returns on multiple-desk
                                    orders will be assessed a restocking fee. Accessories purchased with the desk are subject
                                    to the non-desk return policy listed below.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>No restocking fee is applied for the return of a single desk frame or a single desk with
