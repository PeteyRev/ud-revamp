                                            mean we can&rsquo;t benefit from a little look back every now and again. And
                                            if we&rsquo;ve learned anything from the wisdom of classic rock band reunions,
                                            it&rsquo;s that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with recycling old material. We just
                                            like to keep things a little more literal. Come to think of it, it&rsquo;s actually
                                            pretty easy being green.

                                            we're proud to plant five trees in U.S. National Forests for every solid wood
                                            desktop that we sell. Not only does this help offset our impact on the environment,
                                            but it's one way we're making sure that the resources we use today will be available
                                            for future generations.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Think of it as getting one desk, giving five trees. That's a deal you can't pass

                                            there&rsquo;s always something great to be found inside a hard shell. Our UPLIFT
                                            Eco desks are no exception, only they&rsquo;re more of a treat for your eyes
                                            than your tastebuds. We take 100 percent recycled wood, treat it, heat it, and
                                            cover it in a sleek seamless matte coating to keep you writing, typing, and working
                                            in sensibly sourced style. It&rsquo;s like we put together a fun puzzle with
                                            about ten billion environmentally-friendly pieces. Quite the picture.</p>

                                            others take bridging gigs, and even more spend a good portion of their lives
                                            making up the broad side of a barn. Normally, the end of the game would be retiring
                                            in a bonfire or a nice landfill upstate, but as it turns out you can teach an
                                            old log new tricks. We&rsquo;re just the only ones who know how.</p>

                                            a grass, not a wood. But that&rsquo;s what makes it so green...environmentally
                                            speaking anyway. Aside from keeping pandas looking black and white and cute all
                                            over, bamboo&rsquo;s natural lightning-fast growth rates (seriously, one inch
                                            in under an hour) make it one of the most renewable materials this side of a
