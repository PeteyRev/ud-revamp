                                <p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate

                                <h3>Section 4: BigCommerce</h3>
                                <p>Our store is hosted on BigCommerce. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that
                                    allows us to sell our products and services to you.</p>
                                <p>Your data is stored through BigCommerce&rsquo;s data storage, databases and the general BigCommerce
                                    application. They store your data on a secure server behind a firewall.</p>
                                <p>For more insight, you may also want to read BigCommerce&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/terms/"
                                        target="_blank">Terms of Service here</a> or <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/privacy/"

                                <h3>Section 5: Third-Party Services</h3>
                                <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your
                                    information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide
                                    to us.</p>
                                <p>However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment
                                    transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information
                                    we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
                                </p>
                                <p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand
                                    the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.
                                </p>
                                <p>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that
                                    are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed
                                    with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then
                                    your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that
                                    service provider or its facilities are located.</p>
                                <p>As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment
                                    gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing
                                    that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including
                                    the Patriot Act.</p>
                                <p>Once you leave our store&rsquo;s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application,
                                    you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website&rsquo;s Terms of Service.</p>

                                    responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their
