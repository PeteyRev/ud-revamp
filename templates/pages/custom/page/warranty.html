                                <p>Each one of our UPLIFT Desk products is covered by a limited warranty, based on our confidence
                                    in the superior quality of our frames, motors, electronics, desktops and accessories.</p>
                                <h3>What is covered?</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>UPLIFT Desk frames:</strong> we stand behind our high quality frames, electronics,
                                        and motors. We cover any defects or malfunctions in the desk frame including the
                                        motor, metal/aluminum components, controller, switch, electronics and mechanisms.</li>
                                    <li><strong>UPLIFT desktops:</strong> we cover any desktops that are rendered unusable as
                                        a result of a manufacturer's defect or damage in shipping.</li>
                                    <li><strong>UPLIFT accessories:</strong> we warrant that our accessories are free from any
                                        defects in materials or workmanship.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>What is not covered?</h3>
                                <p>This warranty does not cover any problems which result from improper set-up, unauthorized
                                    modification, normal wear and tear, abuse, or <em>force majeure</em>, such as hurricane
                                    or floods.</p>
                                <p>Imperfections that occur naturally, such as those sometimes found in reclaimed or solid woods,
                                    do not qualify for repairs or replacements. Regardless of how carefully you use, or how
                                    well you care for your desktop, it will eventually begin to show age and wear.</p>
                                <p>Also, consequential (the cost of repairing or replacing other property damaged in the event
                                    of our product malfunctioning) and incidental (loss of time, loss of use) damages are
                                    not recoverable under this warranty. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation
                                    of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not
                                    apply to you.</p>
                                <h3>How long does the coverage last?</h3>
                                <p>Coverage begins on the day you receive your order, warranted to the original owner only,
                                    and lasts the full term listed below.</p>

                                <h3>What we will do</h3>
                                <p>In the rare event that something does go wrong with any of your UPLIFT products, just let
                                    us know. We will replace items or parts at no cost to you, and ship them via standard
                                    ground service anywhere in the lower 48 United States for free. Expedited shipping is
                                    available at your expense. If you are outside the US48, you will be responsible for shipping

                                <p>Warranty support for UPLIFT solid wood desktops includes expert advice from our woodworker
                                    on how to care for your custom desktop, as well as assessment of any issues that may
                                    arise. You will also play a big part in the life of your custom wood desktop. Handmade
                                    wood furniture requires some basic maintenance on your part to keep it in tip-top shape
                                    and looking great for years to come.</p>
                                <p>The UPLIFT Limited Warranty covers only parts, not labor.</p>
