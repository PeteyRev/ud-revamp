                <h2>LET'S BUILD IT TOGETHER</h2>
                <p>Your desk is where you work and create, so it’s important that it’s built to your specification. That’s why we offer a wide range of desktop materials, useful accessories and expert advice. But when off-the-shelf options aren’t enough, we’ll happily work with you to make the height adjustable desk you need. Choose from 100 percent recycled wood desktops in our Eco line. Or, consider a <a href="http://site.thehumansolution.com/UPLIFT/greenguard-certified-laminate.pdf">GREENGUARD-certified</a> laminate desktop, which provides excellent value while being indoor-air friendly and environmentally sound.</p>

            <h2>DIY STANDING DESKS? A-OK</h2>
            <p>Have a desktop you just can’t bear to lose? Or do you prefer to make your own top? We’ve got you covered. The UPLIFT height adjustable desk frame is compatible with any desk at least one inch thick. Our frames lift 355 pounds to start and the telescoping crossbar accommodates desktops up to 90 inches wide and 30 inches deep, so if you can build it, we can handle it.</p>
            <p>With frames available in 2-leg, 3-leg, and 4-leg configurations, we work with almost any size and shape desktop. And if you don’t see what you're looking for, just ask our experts and we'll find a solution.</p>

            <h2>THE KEY TO A HEIGHT ADJUSTABLE DESK</h2>
            <p>Our advanced digital memory keypad stores up to four heights, allowing you to switch between sitting and standing with a quick touch of a button. Your exact desk height is shown on a display that automatically goes dark to reduce power draw while the desk is stationary. This advanced keypad is an upgrade to the standard two-button up/down keypad.</p>

            <h2>TAKE A SEAT</h2>
            <p>Standing all day puts stress on your body just as sitting all day does. We recommend you start your day standing, sit when your feet get tired, and limit sitting to 30 minute sessions. Most studies are now recommending 2-4 hours of standing per 8 hour day. As a bonus, you burn about 50 extra calories per hour when you're standing versus sitting. We offer a full line of ergonomic chairs and stools to help you take a load off throughout the day. And remember, with height adjustability, you'll finally get to work at perfect sitting and standing heights without compromise.</p>
